## ✅ BUGS FIXED IN THIS SESSION

### 1. **Button Visibility Issue - CRITICAL** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/styles.css` lines 106-116
**Severity:** High - UX Breaking

**Problem:**
- All "Back" and "Leave Room" buttons had white text on semi-transparent white backgrounds
- Created white-on-white appearance with poor contrast
- Affected 6+ buttons across the entire UI:
  - Back to Username (line 30)
  - Back to Mode (line 43)
  - Back to Lobby (line 56, 93)
  - Back to Gamemode (line 133)
  - Leave Room (line 147)

**Root Cause:**
```css
.btn-secondary {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);  /* 20% white */
    color: white;  /* White text on white background! */
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```css
.btn-secondary {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);
    color: #333;  /* Dark gray text for contrast */
    text-shadow: none;
    font-weight: 700;
}

.btn-secondary:hover {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
    color: #222;
}
```

**Result:** All secondary buttons now have excellent contrast and readability

## ✅ BUGS FIXED IN PREVIOUS SESSION (Oct 13)

### 2. **Floating-Point Timer Display** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` line 454-456
**Severity:** Medium - Visual Bug

**Problem:**
- Time Bomb mode showed ugly floating-point precision: "15.000000001s"
- Especially bad on Impossible (+0.05s) and Hacker (+0.01s) modes

**Fix:**
```javascript
const displayTime = state.timeRemaining.toFixed(1);
indicator.textContent = `⏰ TIME: ${displayTime}s`;
```

**Result:** Timer now always shows exactly 1 decimal: "15.0s"

---

### 3. **Multiplayer Username Comparison Bug** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 321-323, 451
**Severity:** High - Game Logic Bug

**Problem:**
- Used `state.username` instead of `state.displayUsername` in comparisons
- Broke ICantLose cheat in multiplayer
- Winner detection failed for masked usernames

**Fix:** Changed all comparisons to use `state.displayUsername`

**Result:** Multiplayer now correctly handles masked usernames

---

### 4. **Math.seedrandom Not Actually Seeding** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 418-435
**Severity:** Critical - Game Breaking

**Problem:**
- Seeded random function was defined but `Math.random()` was never overridden
- Multiplayer players got completely different boards
- Defeated entire purpose of "synchronized" multiplayer

**Fix:**
```javascript
const seededRandom = (() => { /* ... */ })();
Math.random = seededRandom;  // Actually override!
// ... generate board ...
setTimeout(() => { Math.random = originalRandom; }, 100);  // Restore
```

**Result:** All players now get identical boards in multiplayer

---

### 5. **Hints Working in Russian Roulette Mode** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 837-840
**Severity:** Medium - Game Design Bug

**Problem:**
- Hints revealed safe cells even though numbers are hidden
- Broke entire point of luck-based mode

**Fix:**
```javascript
if (state.gameMode === 'luck') {
    alert('Hints are not available in Russian Roulette mode!');
    return;
}
```

**Result:** Hints now properly disabled in Russian Roulette

---

### 6. **New Game Button in Multiplayer** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 484-501
**Severity:** Medium - UX Bug

**Problem:**
- "New Game" button caused undefined behavior in multiplayer
- Could break ongoing multiplayer games

**Fix:** Created `handleNewGame()` wrapper that:
- Shows alert if in multiplayer mode
- Properly resets Survival mode to Level 1 in solo
- Only allows new game in solo mode

**Result:** Clean UX, no more multiplayer confusion

---

### 7. **Survival Mode Reset Not Working** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 492-498
**Severity:** Medium - Game Logic Bug

**Problem:**
- "New Game" continued from current Survival level instead of resetting
- No way to restart Survival mode properly

**Fix:** `handleNewGame()` now resets:
- Level to 1
- Total tiles to 0
- Mine count to base value
- UI title

**Result:** Survival mode properly restarts

---

### 8. **Ready Button Stayed Disabled** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 402-404
**Severity:** High - UX Breaking

**Problem:**
- After leaving a room, Ready button stayed disabled forever
- Required page refresh to join another room

**Fix:**
```javascript
function leaveRoom() {
    // ... existing code ...
    document.getElementById('ready-btn').disabled = false;
    document.getElementById('ready-btn').textContent = 'Ready';
}
```

**Result:** Button properly resets on room leave

---

### 9. **1-Player Multiplayer Games** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/app.py` line 298
**Severity:** Medium - Game Logic Bug

**Problem:**
- Minimum player check was `>= 1` instead of `>= 2`
- Single player could start a "multiplayer" game

**Fix:**
```python
if all_ready and len(room["players"]) >= 2:  # Changed from >= 1
```

**Result:** Multiplayer now requires at least 2 players

---

### 10. **Eliminated Flag Not Reset** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/app.py` line 434
**Severity:** High - Game State Bug

**Problem:**
- After game ended, eliminated status carried over
- Players stayed "dead" in subsequent games

**Fix:**
```python
for player in room["players"]:
    # ... existing resets ...
    player["eliminated"] = False  # Added this line
```

**Result:** Clean state between games

---

### 11. **Player List Out of Sync** ❌ → ✅
**Location:** `server/app.py` lines 134, 261; `game.js` lines 285-287
**Severity:** Medium - UI Bug

**Problem:**
- `player_left` event didn't send updated players list
- UI showed outdated player counts

**Fix:** Added `players` array to event payload
**Result:** Player list always synchronized

## 🔍 POTENTIAL BUGS (Not Yet Fixed)

### 12. **Canvas Size Not Responsive** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` line 20, 30
**Severity:** Medium - Mobile UX

**Problem:**
- Cell size is hardcoded to 30px
- 16x16 board = 480px minimum width
- Too large for small mobile screens (<600px)

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
// Calculate responsive cell size
const maxWidth = Math.min(window.innerWidth - 40, 480);
state.cellSize = Math.floor(maxWidth / state.difficulty.cols);
```

---

### 13. **No Input Validation on Room Codes** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 357-367
**Severity:** Low - UX

**Problem:**
- Room code input accepts any characters
- Should only accept uppercase hex characters

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
const roomCode = input.value.trim().toUpperCase().replace(/[^A-F0-9]/g, '');
```

---

### 14. **No Confirmation on Quit** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 1120-1128
**Severity:** Low - UX

**Problem:**
- Quitting a game has no confirmation
- Accidental clicks lose game progress

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
function quitGame() {
    if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to quit? Your progress will be lost.')) {
        return;
    }
    // ... existing quit logic ...
}
```

---

### 15. **Time Bomb Mode Can Go Negative** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 997-1013
**Severity:** Low - Edge Case

**Problem:**
- Timer countdown happens every second
- But `timeRemaining` is a float that can have decimals
- Possible for timer to show "-0.1s" briefly

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
state.timeRemaining = Math.max(0, state.timeRemaining - 1);
```

---

### 16. **No Max Mine Count Validation** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 18, Survival mode
**Severity:** Low - Edge Case

**Problem:**
- Survival mode increases mines each level
- Eventually could try to place more mines than available cells
- Would cause infinite loop in `placeMines()`

**Status:** Partially mitigated by cap at line 760-762 (256 - 20 = 236 max)
**Suggested Additional Fix:** Add validation before board generation

---

### 17. **Leaderboard Doesn't Show Game Mode Icons** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 1057-1082
**Severity:** Low - UX/Polish

**Problem:**
- Global leaderboard shows all modes but no visual indicator
- Hard to tell which mode each score is from

**Suggested Fix:** Add emoji/icon for each game mode in leaderboard

---

### 18. **No "Spectator Mode" After Elimination** ⚠️
**Location:** Multiplayer Russian Roulette
**Severity:** Medium - Feature Gap

**Problem:**
- When eliminated in Russian Roulette, player sees nothing
- No way to watch remaining players

**Suggested Fix:** Show board in read-only mode after elimination

---

### 19. **Connection Lost Has No Reconnect** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` lines 262-265
**Severity:** Medium - Network Handling

**Problem:**
- If connection drops during multiplayer game, no recovery
- Player must refresh page and rejoin (if room still exists)

**Suggested Fix:** Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff

---

### 20. **No Keyboard Navigation** ⚠️
**Location:** Entire UI
**Severity:** Low - Accessibility

**Problem:**
- No keyboard shortcuts except 'H' for hints
- Can't tab between buttons properly
- Not accessible for keyboard-only users

**Suggested Fix:** Add proper `tabindex`, Enter key support, arrow key navigation

---

### 21. **No Touch Event Handlers** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` - Canvas event listeners
**Severity:** High - Mobile UX Breaking

**Problem:**
- Only mouse events (`click`, `contextmenu`) are registered
- No touch event handlers (`touchstart`, `touchend`, `touchmove`)
- Mobile users can't flag mines (no right-click on touch screens)
- No long-press to flag functionality
- Game essentially unplayable on mobile devices

**Current Code:**
```javascript
canvas.addEventListener('click', handleCanvasClick);
canvas.addEventListener('contextmenu', handleCanvasRightClick);
// NO touch events!
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
// Add touch event handlers
let touchStartTime = 0;
let touchStartPos = null;

canvas.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    touchStartTime = Date.now();
    const touch = e.touches[0];
    const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    touchStartPos = {
        x: touch.clientX - rect.left,
        y: touch.clientY - rect.top
    };
});

canvas.addEventListener('touchend', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const touchDuration = Date.now() - touchStartTime;

    if (touchDuration > 500) {
        // Long press = flag
        handleFlag(touchStartPos);
    } else {
        // Quick tap = reveal
        handleReveal(touchStartPos);
    }
});
```

---

### 22. **Canvas Overflow on Small Screens** ⚠️
**Location:** `server/web/game.js` line 20, 488-491
**Severity:** High - Mobile UX Breaking

**Problem:**
- Cell size hardcoded to 30px
- 16×16 board = 480px minimum width
- Overflows on screens < 500px width
- No responsive scaling

**Current Code:**
```javascript
cellSize: 30,  // Hardcoded!

function initCanvas() {
    const width = state.difficulty.cols * state.cellSize;  // Always 480px for 16×16
    const height = state.difficulty.rows * state.cellSize;
    canvas.width = width;
    canvas.height = height;
}
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
function initCanvas() {
    const canvas = document.getElementById('game-canvas');
    const maxWidth = Math.min(window.innerWidth - 40, 600);  // 20px padding each side
    const maxHeight = Math.min(window.innerHeight - 300, 600);  // Leave room for UI

    // Calculate cell size that fits screen
    const cellSizeByWidth = Math.floor(maxWidth / state.difficulty.cols);
    const cellSizeByHeight = Math.floor(maxHeight / state.difficulty.rows);
    state.cellSize = Math.max(15, Math.min(cellSizeByWidth, cellSizeByHeight, 40));

    canvas.width = state.difficulty.cols * state.cellSize;
    canvas.height = state.difficulty.rows * state.cellSize;
}
```

**Impact:** This would make the game fully responsive and playable on all screen sizes.

### 23. **No Mobile-Specific UI Mode** ⚠️
**Location:** Entire UI
**Severity:** Medium - Mobile UX

**Problem:**
- No toggle for "flag mode" on mobile
- Right-click menu not accessible on touch devices
- Small buttons hard to tap (< 44px minimum)
- No visual feedback for touch interactions

**Suggested Fix:**
- Add a "Flag Mode" toggle button for mobile users
- Switch between reveal mode and flag mode with a tap
- Increase button sizes to 44px minimum for touch targets
- Add `:active` pseudo-class styles for touch feedback
